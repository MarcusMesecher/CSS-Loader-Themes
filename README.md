# CSS-Loader-Themes
My personal Steam Deck themes for use with CSS Loader.

# Installation
For all themes I may put here, to install simply put the theme folder in the "/home/deck/homebrew/themes" directory (or install via Decky CSS Loader if I ever decide to put it on there, as of now I have not). (Example directory path: /home/deck/homebrew/themes/New-BG-Color) 

# Custom Background Color
Custom code (from Obsidian by Emerald https://github.com/EMERALD0874/Steam-Deck-Themes) to change the color of only the home, library, etc. menus via the CSS Loader plugin. I found that Obsidian and CapyMenu (all variations) were not compatible with each other. This extension doesn't interfere with the menus that CapyMenu affects but will likely interfere with Obsidian (Obsidian uses more code than my implementation so by default it should be disabled if using my plugin). By default, the colors available are grey and oled black along with the option to choose a custom color. Let me know of any issues so I can improve it for the both of us.
