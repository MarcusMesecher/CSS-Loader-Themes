# CSS-Loader-Themes
My personal Steam Deck themes for use with CSS Loader.

# Obsidian
A version of Emerald's Obsidian theme (https://github.com/EMERALD0874/Steam-Deck-Themes) that is compatible with CapyMenu. It should only inject into the Steam Deck menu and the Library menu. Let me know of any issues so I can improve it for the both of us.
