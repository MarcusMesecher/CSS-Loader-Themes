# CSS-Loader-Themes
My personal Steam Deck themes for use with CSS Loader.

# Installation
For all themes I may put here, to install simply put the theme folder in the "/home/deck/homebrew/themes" directory and **DON'T UPDATE THE PLUGIN THROUGH DECKY! EVER!** This discards all changes I made and you'll need to redo the process. If there's a feature added in a newer version, let me know and I'll update. (Example directory path: /home/deck/homebrew/themes/Obsidian) 

# Obsidian
A version of Emerald's Obsidian theme (https://github.com/EMERALD0874/Steam-Deck-Themes) that is compatible with CapyMenu. It should only inject into the Steam Deck menu and the Library menu. Let me know of any issues so I can improve it for the both of us.
